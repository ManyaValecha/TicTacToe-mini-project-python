This project implements a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game in Python.
Players can take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the board, and the game continues until one player wins or the board is full.
Features:
The game board is displayed using a 3x3 grid.
Players can input their moves by specifying the position (0-8) where they want to place their mark.
The game checks for a win condition after each move.
The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If no player wins and the board is full, the game ends in a draw.
How to Play:
Run the Python script.
Players take turns entering their moves.
The game displays the updated board after each move.
The game ends when a player wins or the board is full.
